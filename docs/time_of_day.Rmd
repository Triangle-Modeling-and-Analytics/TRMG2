# Introduction
This page details the steps taken to determine the most appropriate time period
definitions for the Triangle Regional Model (TRMG2). Caliper used the processed
household survey to perform the analysis.

```{r read survey, include = FALSE}
# This file is created by the Generation-Resident.Rmd
tripTbl <- read_csv("data/output/_PRIVATE/survey_processing/trips_processed.csv")
```

# Peak period determination

*(To skip to the final period definitions, click [here](#final_defs).)*

Peak period determination is based on an analysis of the trips in motion
throughout the day. First, the day is broken up into 15-minute increments. A
trip from the household survey is said to be "in motion" if any portion of the
trip occurs within the 15-minute bin. As a result, a single trip can be counted
in multiple bins. Determining the peak period considers the distribution of all
trips as well as the distribution of trips on work tours individually. The chart
below shows these two distributions, which look as expected with the AM peak
being shorter and more condensed than the PM. 

```{r}
bin_size = 15 # minutes

# Vector of time by 15 minutes
v_time <- seq(0, 24, by = bin_size / 60) * 60

# Determine how many trips (all purposes) fall in each bin
v_all <- c()
for (i in 1:length(v_time)) {
  v_all[i] <- sum(
    tripTbl$trip_weight_combined[
      tripTbl$departure_time < v_time[i + 1] & 
        tripTbl$arrival_time >= v_time[i]
    ],
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
}

# Determine how many trips (work purpose) fall in each bin
work_trips <- tripTbl %>%
  mutate(
    work_trip = ifelse(
      tour_type == "W", #& homebased == "HB" & purp_scheme == "W",
      # (o_activity == "W" | d_activity == "W") &
      #   (o_activity == "H" | d_activity == "H"),
      1, 0
    )
  )

v_wrk <- c()
for (i in 1:length(v_time)) {
  v_wrk[i] <- sum(
    work_trips$trip_weight_combined[
      work_trips$departure_time < v_time[i + 1] & 
        work_trips$arrival_time >= v_time[i] & 
        work_trips$work_trip == 1
    ]
  )
}

timTbl <- tibble(
  time = v_time,
  AllTrips = v_all,
  WrkTrips = v_wrk
)
```

```{r time_conv_formula}
# Formula for converting minutes to chart format (e.g. 1000 for 10:00 am)
chart_time <- function(minutes){
  ((minutes %/% 60) * 100 + (minutes %% 60)) / 100
}
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tbl <- timTbl %>%
  mutate(time = chart_time(time))

plot_ly(
  tbl, x = ~time, y = ~AllTrips, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "All",
  hoverinfo = "text+x", text = ~format(round(AllTrips, 0), big.mark = ",")
) %>%
  add_trace(
    x = ~time, y = ~WrkTrips, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Work",
    hoverinfo = "text+x", text = ~format(round(WrkTrips, 0), big.mark = ",")
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Distribution of Trips in Motion by Purpose",
    xaxis = list(title = "Time of Day"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Trips in Motion")
  )
```

The next step is to determine the peak hour for all trips and those on work
tours. In the tables below, the AM and PM peak hours by type are presented. At
a minimum, the AM and PM peak periods should contain the respective peak hour
for work trips and all trips. The chart below shows that the peak hour for work
and all trips are exactly the same in the Triangle region based on the surveys 
as is often, but not always, the case.

```{r}
# Create rolling sums to determine peak hour
an = function(n, len) c(seq.int(n), rep(n, len-n))
n = an(60 / bin_size, nrow(timTbl))

## Final Period Definitions {#final_defs}

Based on the trips in motion profile, there are four distinct periods of the
day. AM and PM peaks have the highest intensity of trip making, followed by
mid-day, with the overnight period containing the fewest trips in motion. 
Boundaries for these periods are defined such that the variance of trips in
motion within periods is smallest while variance between periods is largest.

The final period definitions are shown in the table below including the mid-day
(MD) period. The remaining hours of the day are captured in the night (NT)
period. In the chart, the final period is represented by the gray rectangle.

# Time of day factors
With the periods defined, the percent of trips produced by purpose and time of
day must be determined. These factors are calculated based on the departure
time of each trip rather than using the trips in motion table. This ensures
that each trip is only counted once, regardless of duration, and that it is
included in the right period. These factors are used to divide the daily person
trips created during trip generation into time of day (by purpose).

Directionality factors are calculated separately in the next section. As a
reference, the time period definition is shown again first followed by the TOD
factors.

desc[2] = "into period-specific values"
tod_factors$Description <- desc
```

# Directionality factors
For most steps in a trip-based model, the trips are said to be in
"Production/Attraction" (PA) format. In this format, all home-based trips are
considered to start at home and end somewhere else (even if the person is
actually traveling back home). This simplification of reality is done for a
number of reasons related to model estimation, but is not actually how travel
occurs. As a result, before highway assignment can take place, the PA
format must be converted to "Origin/Destination" (OD) format. In this format, a
trip from work to home starts at work and ends at home.

This conversion is accomplished using factors stratified by time of day and trip
type. As an example, the majority of W_HB_W_All (i.e. HBW) trips in the AM start
at home and end at work. As a result, the PA-to-OD factor would be above 0.5. In
the PM period, this trend is usually reversed, and the PA factor would be less
than 0.5.

These factors can be calculated directly from the survey by comparing the number
of home-based trips that start at home to the number home-based trips that start
elsewhere. The table below shows the PA factors calculated from the survey by
trip type.

```{r calc_pa_factors}
direction_tbl <- tripTbl %>%
  filter(homebased == "HB", tour_type != "H") %>%
  group_by(trip_type, tod, pa_flag) %>%
  summarize(trips = sum(trip_weight_combined)) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = trips / sum(trips),
    tod = factor(tod, levels = c("AM", "MD", "PM", "NT"), ordered = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(pa_flag == 1) %>%
  select(-trips, -pa_flag) %>%
  rename(pa_fac = pct) %>%
  arrange(trip_type, tod)

direction_tbl %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "tod", values_from = "pa_fac"
  ) %>%
  rename(`Trip Type` = trip_type) %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

By definition, non-home-based trips are the same in either format;
their PA factors are set to .5. The same treatment is applied to commercial
vehicles, trucks, and external trips.

Directionality factors are applied after the distribution and modal
models. At that point, trip types are collapsed due to sample size
limitations in the household survey. As a result, the factors must be estimated
using the matching, more-aggregate purposes.

## Treatment of skims

In the TRMG2, the directionality factors are used to further improve the
period-specific skims. The easiest way to explain the improvement is using the PM
period as an example. 

In the PM period, 95% of home-based work trips in the survey are traveling back
home. Trip productions estimated by the model are in PA format and, with a
traditional approach, would see skim times from home to work, which are near
free-flow speed. This unrealistic representation of travel time would cause
incorrect mode and destination choices to be predicted.

To properly represent aggregate travel times, the PA and AP directions must be
combined using a weighted average as shown below:

$$TT_{avg} = f_{pa} * TT_{ij} + (1 - f_{pa}) * TT_{ji}$$

Where:  
$TT_{avg}$ is the average travel time from zone i to j;
$f_{pa}$ is the PA factor;
$TT_{ij}$ is the travel time from zone i to j; and
$TT_{ji}$ is the travel time from zone j to i.

The table below shows the directional factors used to average skims. Note that
for non-home-based trips and all off-peak trips, a simple 50/50 split was used.
For home-based trips in the off-peak, the survey showed that the directionality
was close enough to 50/50 that the extra complexity was not warranted.

```{r, include = FALSE}
skim_facs <- read_csv("../master/resident/tod/directionality_skim_factors.csv")
```

```{r}
skim_facs %>%
  rename(
    Period = period, Homebased = homebased, `Tour Type` = tour_type, 
    PA = pa, AP = ap
  ) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```


# Vehicle occupancy factors
In addition to applying directionality factors before assignment, the person 
trip matrices are converted to vehicles using occupancy factors. These factors
are calculated from the household survey, which includes information on the
party size of each trip. The rates below meet expectations. The mode categories
used are defined as follows:

- SOV: Single occupancy
- HOV2: 2-person occupancy
- HOV3: 3+ person occupancy

Vehicle occupancy for SOV and HOV2 modes are 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. The
table below shows the occupancy calculated for HOV3.

```{r calculate veh occ factors}
occ_tbl <- tripTbl %>%
  filter(tour_type != "H", !is.na(mode_final)) %>%
  filter(mode_final %in% c("sov", "hov2", "hov3")) %>%

    Value = round(weighted.mean(party_size, w = trip_weight_combined), 3),
    Samples = n(),
  ) %>%
  # Low samples for some rows leads to high factors (e.g. 4.9). If the sample size
  # is low, use the daily average.

# Period capacity factors
In aggregate period assignment regimes, hourly capacities must be
converted to period capacities in a manner that accurately captures the balance
of congestion. In the real world, the hourly capacity of a road is generally
the same throughout the day; it is the demand that changes. This change in
demand causes congestion levels to change over time. Consider the
stylized example below of a real world street segment.

## Qualitative example

Note that capacity remains fixed while demand changes.

```{r}
real_world <- tibble(
  Time = c("6-7", "7-8", "8-9"),
  Capacity = c(1050, 1050, 1050),
  Demand = c(500, 900, 500)
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = round(Demand / Capacity * 100, 2))

real_world %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

plot_ly(
  real_world,
  x = ~Time, y = ~Capacity, type = "bar", name = "Capacity"
) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~Time, y = ~Demand, type = "bar", name = "Demand") %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Hour of Day"), yaxis = list(title = "Veh per Hour")
  )
```

The easiest way to represent this in a period assignment would be to add up the
total capacity and total demand from each hour.

```{r}
model_period <- tibble(
  Time = c("6-9"),
  Capacity = c(sum(real_world$Capacity)),
  Demand = c(sum(real_world$Demand))
)

model_period %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

plot_ly(
  model_period,
  x = ~Time, y = ~Capacity, type = "bar", name = "Capacity"
) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~Time, y = ~Demand, type = "bar", name = "Demand") %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Hour of Day"), yaxis = list(title = "Veh per Hour")
  )
```

In this simple representation, no one experiences congestion. This does not
match the real world graph, which shows that nearly half the vehicles in the
period experience congested conditions. This occurs between 7:00 am and 8:00 am.
This discrepancy between the real world and a naive period representation can
cause numerous errors in the model, including:

- Longer trip lengths
- Incorrect route choices
- Lower diversion to transit
- Incorrect link assignment

The period capacity factor (PCF) corrects for this, and is the inverse of a
similar concept from traffic engineering: the peak hour factor (PHF). In traffic
engineering, the PHF adjusts hourly volume based on the highest 15-minute volume
within the hour. While the PHF is used to adjust demand given a fixed capacity,
the PCF adjusts period capacity based on the highest-volume hour of the period.

Consider our example of a three-hour period from 6:00 am to 9:00 am. If the
actual demand was evenly distributed across the period, the PHF would be .33. 
The PCF, the inverse of the PHF, would be 3. In this scenario, the hourly
capacity would be multiplied by 3, which would lead to the capacity shown in the
table above. Instead, using the actual demand from our example, the PHF would
be:

$$PHF = 900 /(500 + 900 + 500) = 0.474$$

Taking the inverse gives a PCF of:

$$PCF = 1 / .474 = 2.11$$

The period capacity that most-accurately reflects congestion would be:

$$Period Capacity = 1050 * 2.11 = 2215$$

That capacity is shown relative to the period demand in the chart below. This
relationship is a better representation of real world conditions.

```{r}
final_period <- tibble(
  PCF = c("PCF = 3.00", "PCF = 2.11"),
  Demand = rep(sum(real_world$Demand), 2)
)
final_period <- final_period %>%
  mutate(Capacity = c(3150, round(2.11 * 1050, 0)) - Demand)

plot_ly(
  final_period,
  x = ~PCF, y = ~Demand, type = "bar", name = "Demand", 
  marker = list(color = "ff7f0e")
) %>%
  add_trace(
    x = ~PCF, y = ~Capacity, type = "bar", name = "Capacity",
    marker = list(color = "1f77b4")
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Final Model Representation",
    xaxis = list(title = ""),
    yaxis = list(title = "Veh per Period"),
    barmode = "stack"
  )

final_period %>%
  mutate(
    Capacity = Demand + Capacity,
    `% of Capacity` = round(Demand / Capacity * 100, 2)
  ) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Calculation from survey
The PCFs for the model can be calculated from the trips in motion table using
the same approach. The results are shown in the table below.

```{r calc_pcf}
breaks <- c(am_peak_from, am_peak_to, pm_peak_from, pm_peak_to)
breaks <- as.numeric(breaks) * 1440
labels <- c("AM", "MD", "PM")

# an = function(n, len) c(seq.int(n), rep(n, len-n))
n = an(60 / bin_size, nrow(timTbl))

pcf_tbl <- timTbl %>%
  group_by(tod = cut(time, breaks = breaks, labels = labels)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    tod = as.character(tod),
    tod = ifelse(is.na(tod), "NT", tod),
    # Use factors to set display order in table
    tod = factor(
      tod,
      levels = c("AM", "MD", "PM", "NT"),
      ordered = TRUE
      )
    ) %>%
  group_by(tod) %>%
  mutate(
    # all_trips_in_hour = rollapplyr(AllTrips, 60 / bin_size, sum, partial = TRUE)
    all_trips_in_hour = frollsum(AllTrips, an(60 / bin_size, n()), na.rm = TRUE, adaptive = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    PHF = max(all_trips_in_hour) / sum(AllTrips),
    PCF = 1 / PHF
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    From = c(am_peak_from, am_peak_to, pm_peak_from, pm_peak_to),
    To = c(am_peak_to, pm_peak_from, pm_peak_to, am_peak_from),
    Length = ifelse(
      tod != "NT",
      (To - From) * 1440 / 60,
      (1 - as.numeric(From) + as.numeric(To)) * 1440 / 60
    )
  ) %>%
  # Reorder and rename for display
  select(Period = tod, From, To, Length, PHF, PCF)

total <- round(sum(pcf_tbl$PCF), 2)

pcf_tbl %>%
  rename(`Length (hrs)` = Length, `Model Capacity (hrs)` = PCF) %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

A [general
guideline](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/tmip/publications/other_reports/validation_and_reasonableness_2010/ch08.cfm)
to follow suggests the model should provide 8-12 hours of capacity per day. The
PCFs calculated directly from the survey data provide `r total`. This is slightly
higher but acceptable.
