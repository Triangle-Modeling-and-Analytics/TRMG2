## Introduction

Due to the small size of the transit market in the Triangle and the small
household survey sample size, the household survey does not contain enough
transit observations to estimate behavioral models for transit users. On-board
surveys are critical to fill this gap. They are intercept surveys, which means
they are conducted on the bus itself. They ask transit riders a series of
questions in order to obtain detailed information about demographics, trip
purpose, modes used, and other variables.

In the Triangle, a survey of 9,231 GoTriangle and DCHC area transit riders was
conducted in 2014 (excluding Duke Transit). 5,390 CAMPO area transit riders were
surveyed in 2015 along with new GoTriangle routes. These are used to gain
insight into the transit market.

## Combining surveys

Unlike the household surveys, the transit surveys were collected by different
companies. Combining the surveys required translating different field codes
into a combined set of values. The surveys collected the same basic
information, which made this process easier. Additionally, because different
routes were collected in each survey, no routes were double counted and no
adjustments to the sample weights were needed.

## Geocoding

As with the household survey, the transit trip latitude/longitude values were
translated into TRMG2 TAZs. For a transit trip, this includes the home, origin
(which could be somewhere other than home), destination, boarding, and alighting
locations. A sample of this is shown in the table below:

```{r, include=FALSE}
tazs <- st_read("data/input/tazs/master_tazs.shp") %>%
  st_transform(crs = st_crs('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84'))
```

```{r}
# create unique list of lat/long points

  lng = c(
    combined$orig_lon,

  ),

```

## Reasonableness checks {.tabset}

A high level review of the combined survey was performed to make sure field
translations and survey combination had not introduced errors. Some of those
checks are shown in the charts below. All dimensions checked looked reasonable.

### Agency

The distribution by agency lines up fairly well with the size of the agencies
themselves.

```{r}
temp <- add_mode %>%
  mutate(agency = ifelse(agency == "TTA", "GoTriangle", agency)) %>%
  group_by(agency) %>%
  summarize(weight = sum(weight)) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(weight / sum(weight) * 100, 0)
  )

ggplot(temp, aes(x = reorder(agency, -pct), y = pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = agency)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(
    title = "Agency Distribution",
    x = "Agency",
    y = "Percent"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```


### Time of Day

The time period definitions are the same as those
defined in the [time of day](time_of_day.html) documentation. The AM period, for
example, is only 2 hours. This explains the large number of transit observations
categorized as midday.

```{r}
temp <- add_mode %>%
  group_by(tod) %>%
  summarize(weight = sum(weight)) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(weight / sum(weight) * 100, 0),
    tod = factor(tod, levels = c("AM", "MD", "PM", "NT"))
  ) %>%
  arrange(tod)

ggplot(temp, aes(x = tod, y = pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = tod)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(
    title = "Time of Day Distribution",
    x = "Time of Day",
    y = "Percent"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```

### Access Mode

Walk access is the dominant mode in the survey, which matches transit behavior
in the region.

```{r}
temp <- add_mode %>%
  group_by(access_mode) %>%
  summarize(weight = sum(weight)) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(weight / sum(weight) * 100, 0),
  )

ggplot(temp, aes(x = reorder(access_mode, -pct), y = pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "gold") +
  labs(
    title = "Access Mode Distribution",
    x = "Access Mode",
    y = "Percent"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```

### Fare Type

Free routes are the most common, which is a reflection of the CHT system which
offers many routes with no fare.

```{r}
temp <- add_mode %>%
  group_by(fare_type) %>%
  summarize(weight = sum(weight)) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(weight / sum(weight) * 100, 0)
  )

ggplot(temp, aes(x = reorder(fare_type, -pct), y = pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = fare_type)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(
    title = "Fare Type Distribution",
    x = "Fare Type",
    y = "Percent"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```


## Survey Assignment

Caliper assigned the combined transit survey to the 2016 transit route networks
used by the model. Neither survey was collected in 2016, so route offerings are
likely different. However, assigning the survey can help identify errors in the
networks. These can include missing access links or route mis-coding, but also
gives insights into things transfers. If the model is not penalizing transfers
enough, this early assignment will show more transfers than in the survey.

The assignment process involved processing the survey into the appropriate
matrices by time of day, transit mode, and accesss mode. The model's assignment
macros in TransCAD were used to assign the matrices to the route system, and the
results were compared to reported ridership by route. One of the conclusions
was in fact that transfers needed to be penalized heavier in the transit network
settings. In the survey, no one transferred more than once.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This code chunk was used to create transit matrices for a test assignment.
# It does not need to be run each time the page is knit, but is kept as
# a reference.
library(caliperR)
source("R/create_obs_matrices.R")
temp <- add_mode %>%
  filter(access_mode != "other", !is.na(mode)) %>%
  group_by(board_time, access_mode, mode) %>%
  nest()

create_obs_matrices(temp)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
model_boardings <- read_csv(
  "data/input/obs_processing/model_boardings_and_alightings.csv") %>%
  filter(tod == "Daily") %>%
  select(rts_name, model_boardings = On)

reported_boardings <- read_excel(
  "data/input/obs_processing/reported_ridership.xlsx", sheet = "reported")
reported_equiv <- read_excel(
  "data/input/obs_processing/reported_ridership.xlsx", sheet = "equiv")
```

```{r}
comparison <- reported_equiv %>%
  left_join(reported_boardings, by = c("reported_route" = "route")) %>%
  group_by(reported_route) %>%
  mutate(
    count = n(),
    ridership_2016 = ridership_2016 / count
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(model_route, reported = ridership_2016) %>%
  left_join(model_boardings, by = c("model_route" = "rts_name")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(model_boardings), !is.na(reported)) %>%
  mutate(
    diff = model_boardings - reported,
    abs_diff = abs(diff),
    pct_diff = round(diff / reported * 100, 2)
  ) %>%
  # Duke routes are not included in either survey combined, so don't include them
  # for RMSE calculation
  filter(!grepl("DUKE", model_route))

route_prmse <-  round(
  Metrics::rmse(comparison$model_boardings, comparison$reported) / 
    mean(comparison$reported) * 100, 2
)

agency_comp <- comparison %>%
  separate(
    model_route, into = c("agency", "route"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE,
    extra = "merge"
  ) %>%
  group_by(agency) %>%
  summarize(reported = sum(reported), model_boardings = sum(model_boardings)) %>%
  mutate(
    reported = round(reported, 0),
    model_boardings = round(model_boardings, 0),
    diff = model_boardings - reported,
    abs_diff = abs(diff),
    pct_diff = round(diff / reported * 100, 2)
  )

agency_prmse <- round(
  Metrics::rmse(agency_comp$model_boardings, agency_comp$reported) / 
    mean(agency_comp$reported) * 100, 2
)
```

The percent root mean square error (%RMSE) for route-level boardings was
`r route_prmse`%. The agency-level %RMSE was `r round(agency_prmse, 2)`%. The
table below shows the agency-level comparison.

```{r}
agency_comp %>%
  filter(!(agency %in% c("CLX", "FRX"))) %>%
  rename(
    Agency = agency,
    Observed = reported,
    Modelled = model_boardings,
    Difference = diff,
    `Absolute Difference` = abs_diff,
    `Percent Difference` = pct_diff
  ) %>%

```

These differences are large, but manual path checking did not uncover any
errors. This test assignment was performed on a network with a rough initial
guess of travel times, which contributed to these differences. Further
differences may be because the surveys were from 2014 and 2015 while the transit
network is 2016. Any changes in route alignments or offerings would lead to
higher discrepancies.

During model development, much more accurate roadway times were calculated from
actual model assignments. Further, the transit network settings were also dialed
in to achieve final results that look much more reasonable.
