## Introduction

Accessibility is a measure of a traveler's ability to reach locations where they
can engage in necessary and desired activities.

Accessibility can be measured in various ways and different measures are useful
for different purposes. It is not uncommon for planners to use accessibility
measures such as the number of jobs accessible within a 30 minute commute
because measures such as this are readily understandable. However, metrics like
this are not as good for analysis and modeling because they can exhibit
significant discontinuities or "cliff-effects" where, for example, a large
employer is 31 versus 29 minutes away. For this reason, in travel models, more
continuous but sometimes less intuitive accessibility measures are used.  

Another way accessibility can be measured, more similarly to the way it is
commonly measured in models is the average cost (usually in terms of minutes) of
a trip from a given location, perhaps for a particular purpose, by a particular
mode, and/or at a particular time of day.

Accessibilities, thought of as the average or expected cost of a trip, affect
many aspects of travel behavior and are therefore included in many components of
behaviorally realistic advanced travel models. The average cost of trips (in
miles) from a residence location clearly affects auto ownership because, for
instance if most activity destinations can be reached within a mile, a car is
not necessary. Residents of dense, highly-accessible areas also can afford to
make more trips, because their trips are shorter on average, and so they can accomplish
more trips in the same travel time budget. Thus, downtown dwellers make more,
shorter trips than the regional average and rural residents make fewer, but
longer trips. Although some older trip-based models partially reflected this
through the stratification of trip generation rates by area type, the use of
continuous accessibility variables in generation models is clearly preferable
both in terms of statistical support and model response properties. To fully and
accurately reflect this fundamental difference between travel patterns by
residents of different parts of the region, accessibility must also be
incorporated in destination choice. The accessibility of the home location
scales residents' willingness to travel (sensitivity to travel time) because when
a person chooses their residence location, they are also choosing how far they
are generally willing to travel.  The accessibility of destinations is also a 
factor in destination choice because it measures the cost of an additional 
(non-home-based) trip from that location.  

A number of accessibility measures are therefore used in the TRM to model these
various effects of accessibility on travel behavior and patterns.

## Maps {.tabset}

The maps below show the regional pattern of the various accessibility metrics
used by the model. Below the maps, more detail on each metric is provided.

## Details

### Intersection Approach Density

Intersection approach density is an important measure of walk accessibility that
does not require parcel level zones or place data. It is used as a component of
a more comprehensive walkability (or walk accessibility) variable in the TRM. In
the language of urban planning, it measures urban design.  

Intersection approach density as a metric recognizes that dense, gridded street
systems are more conducive to walking than sparse suburban development forms
with many dead ends, cul-de-sacs, and three-way intersections. To calculate this
metric, each node in the network was evaluated to determine how many
(non-freeway) streets were connected to it (a minimum of three required to be an
intersection). Each of these connected links is an "intersection approach".
Within each zone, the total number of these approaches was summed and then
divided by the zonal area to arrive at a density which measures both the average
block size or density and street network connectivity.

### Gini-Simpson Index (D)

The Gini-Simpson Index is a diversity index used for measuring the diversity of
many types of phenomenon in various social sciences (such as income and racial
diversity). In the context of travel modeling and the TRM, the index is used to
measure the diversity of land uses or degree of "mixed use" in a zone. In this
way, it can be thought of as a type of intra-zonal accessibility measure.

Formally, the Gini-Simpson Index in this context is the probability that two
places (trip ends or activities) within a zone (i) will belong to different
types (g); where we have taken types simply as home, work, and other activities:  

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/accessibility/GiniSimpsonD.png")
```

### Stop Proximity

This is a common metric in travel models given its power at describing zonal
accessibility to transit. In the TRMG2, the percent of each zone within 1/4 mile
of a bus stop is computed using a GIS overlay in TransCAD. The map below zooms
in to Apex to give an illustration of how this calculation works.

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/accessibility/bus_stop_detail.png")
```

### Walkability

For each zone, a binary choice model was applied to determine the propensity to
walk for trips originating in that zone. Simple by design, it does not consider
skims or other matrix-based attributes. Instead, it uses the metrics below to
make predictions.

- **Approach Density**: Intersection approaches in zone divided by zonal area
- **Attraction Density**: Total attractions divided by zonal area.
- **GS Index**: Gini-Simpson Diversity Index
- **Constant (walk)**: Constant applied to the walk utility equation

Adjusted rho-squared: 0.45

```{r}
model <- tibble(
  Term = c(
    "Approach Density",
    "Attraction Density",
    "GS Index",
    "Constant (walk)"
  ),
  Coeff = c(
    .16,
    .23,
    .12,
    -1.96
  ),
  `T-Stat` = c(
    12.1,
    24.8,
    9.5,
    -141
  )
)

### Logsums

Logsums can be considered as a weighted average accessibility. While logsums are
most often discussed in relation to mode choice and destination choice models,
the logsums used for these accessibility measures are based on a simpler gravity
formulation as a proxy and to avoid endogeneity problems from simultaneously
estimating destination choice models including logsums of those same and other
destination choice models.

$$A_i = ln(\sum_j S_jt_{ijm}^{\alpha}e^{\beta t^{ijm}})$$

Where:  
$A_i$: Accessibility of zone i  
$t_{ijm}$: Travel time between zone i and j by mode m  
$S_j$: Attractions in zone j (size term)

The primary purpose for these mode-specific accessibility values is to inform
the non-home-based models. For instance, a non-home-based transit trip is likely
to occur in areas with high transit accessibility. More importantly, they cannot
occur in areas with no transit access.

```{r, include=FALSE}
tbl <- read_csv("../master/accessibility/attraction_rates.csv")
```

In addition to calculating accessibility logsums by mode, three different size
term formulations were used to capture different types of access. Those three
types are:

- General: A balanced accessibility to various land uses
- Nearby: An accessibility that weights land uses more heavily that generate
  shorter trips (e.g. retail)
- Employment: A measure of accessibility to employment/jobs

The rates for the size term in each of the above types of accessibility are
shown in the table below.

```{r}
tbl %>%
  select(Field, General = general_attr, Nearby = nearby_attr, 
         Employment = employment_attr) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(Field, "Building")) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
