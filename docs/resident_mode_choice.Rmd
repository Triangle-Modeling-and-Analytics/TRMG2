This document summarizes the mode choice (MC) models estimated using travel
survey and other data from the Triangle region. These are nested logit models
that predict which modes of travel will be used based on things like travel
time, transit fare, and transit headway. Mode choice models play a crucial role
in model estimation, not only directly but also through logsums that are then
used to inform destination choices. For more information on mode choice models,
click [here](https://tfresource.org/topics/Mode_choice.html).

## Key considerations

In addition to the usual key drivers of mode choices such as level-of-service
variables, there were key modeling requirements for the Triangle region.

One of the key modeling requirements for the Triangle region is the focus on
transit usage and ability to analyze the congestion mitigation potential of
future transit projects. To that end, a detailed transit mode choice component
is warranted. In addition to the household travel survey, Caliper had access to
a transit onboard survey. While the proportion of transit trips in the household
survey is in accordance with regional shares, this data alone was not sufficient
to estimate parameters for transit sub-modes. Rather than combine the onboard
survey with the household survey (for various reasons including inconsistency
between trip type), Caliper estimated detailed transit sub-mode models
conditional on the main transit choice using the onboard survey. This is
illustrated in later sections.

A second consideration was the need to measure future transit modes such as bus
rapid transit, light rail, and commuter rail. These modes do not exist today, so
Caliper leaned on FTA/STOPS guidance.

A key mode identified during exploratory analysis was the Non-HH Auto mode, that
is comprised of ride sharing and rental cars (classified together as AutoPay)
and borrowed cars (e.g. a friend's car and classified as OtherAuto).

Parking was a major consideration for the auto modes, especially in designated
parking districts in the CBD/downtown/university areas of cities in the Triangle
region, where parking space is limited.

For Non-Home Based (NHB) trips, the trip mode is conditional based on the mode
of the home-based leg of the tour. Hence mode choice models were not estimated
for these trips.

## Approach

The initial determination was whether to combine the household travel survey
with the on-board survey and subsequently estimate a model using the entire set
of modes (including the transit sub-modes). This would entail potential
re-calculation of the survey weights.

The alternate approach was to estimate conditional transit sub-mode models using
the onboard survey and then estimate a nested mode choice model using all the
modes but fixing the transit sub-mode utility coefficients as appropriate.
Essentially, the logsum computed from the transit nest would be the key utility
component for the main transit alternative. The transit sub-mode model can also
be viewed as a model that predicts transit sub-mode shares conditional on the
main mode being chosen as transit.

A closer look at the onboard survey revealed that while the data regarding the
transit sub-mode was rich, the information regarding the tour type was not
available. Whether trips are work, other or shop related could be ascertained
from the onboard survey but there was no information regarding tour types or the
overall travel pattern of the individual respondent. Given that the trip
purposes in TRMG2 are designed based on the tour type and trip type, records
from the onboard survey could not be matched directly to the TRM trip purpose
definitions. Therefore, the alternate approach of estimating transit sub-models
from the onboard survey was chosen.

Given the above, the mode choice estimation approach for the TRM followed a
two-stage process:

### Stage 1

Estimate Transit sub-mode models (nest) for three main types (Work, Shop and
Other) from the onboard survey. The transit nest is organized by access mode and
transit mode, which was revealed by the estimation process. The three access
modes are Walk, Park & Ride (PNR) and Kiss & Ride (KNR). The modes in the base
year include local bus (LB) and express bus (EB), and these are the only modes
with estimated coefficients.

### Stage 2

Estimate a nested model for each trip purpose in TRMG2. The top-level choices
are the main modes namely Auto, Non-HH Auto and Transit. The Auto nest includes
the sub-modes SOV, HOV2 and HOV3. The Non-HH Auto nest includes the modes
AutoPay and OtherAuto.  The appropriate Transit nest is stitched by keeping the
utilities and the coefficients from the transit nest models fixed (essentially
fixing the logsums). For some trip purposes, certain transit access modes were
dropped if there were no observations in the survey. The parameters of the
utility function of the various auto modes, ASC’s and nest coefficients for the
top-level alternatives are estimated during the process. Certain key utility
terms common to a particular nest (e.g., Transit) were added to the appropriate
nest alternative (e.g., to the Transit alternative) to capture the fundamental
choice of the main mode. A weighted estimation was performed using the trip
final weights.

The conceptual figure of a typical nested model is presented in the figure. Note
that the utility coefficients and structure for the Transit come from the
estimations in Stage 1 described above. For instance, for the w_hb_w purpose,
where the tour mode is work and the trip mode is work, the transit nest for the
work transit purpose is used in the final mode choice specification.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/full_tree.png")
```

In the following sections, the three Transit nest models are first described,
followed by the completed models for each of the TRM trip purposes.

# Transit Submodels

## Work

This model is estimated from the onboard survey for work trips. All six
combinations of transit and access mode are considered, and the estimated model
has the nested structure below, nested by access mode and then by transit mode.
The estimation process indicated that this nesting structure (rather than main
mode first followed by access mode), was more appropriate for the Triangle. This
reflects the large differences in behavior between households with and without
autos. For most people, they must first determine if driving is an option. If it
isn't, they can only take transit if they can walk to it.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_work.png")
```

### Utility specification

The utility specification mainly comprises of the level of service transit
variables and auto sufficiency market segmentation terms. The utility equations
are shown in the first table below where the letter ‘X’ indicates that the
variable is included in the utility equation for the appropriate alternative
(column). The alternative-specific constant (ASC) row shows the estimated
constant values with the corresponding tStat within the brackets. The three nest
coefficients are also shown with their tStats.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_work.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_work2.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_work3.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_work4.png")
```

As expected, transit LOS variables are significant. A fare coefficient could not
be directly estimated. Instead, a VOT of 11.9 $/hr was used to convert the fare
to equivalent time and a time coefficient was estimated. This ensures that the
model is sensitive to changes in fare policy.

Nested Logit estimation is known to be non-unique and is influenced by the
starting values of the nest coefficients. This implies that potentially several
estimations must be run with a different set of starting nest coefficients.
After a wide range of experiments on the TRM data, it was necessary to fix the
PNR nest coefficient to 1 (implying that PNR_LB and PNR_EB are treated as
top-level modes).

As expected, households with zero vehicles tend to prefer walk access to transit
options. Similarly, vehicle insufficient households prefer not to use PNR since
that would presumably make the vehicle unusable while in the parking lot.

## Other

The transit sub-model estimated for the other purpose has a similar structure to
the work purpose.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_other1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_other3.png")
```

Again, a VOT of 11.9 $/hr was used to obtain the fare coefficient.

## Shop

The onboard survey revealed that it is very unlikely that shop trips use PNR and
KNR, which is intuitive. If a household has access to a car with which to make a
PNR/KNR trip, they would prefer to simply drive directly to the store and have
an easy way to transport groceries or other purchases. As a result, the transit
alternatives consist only of the walk access modes.

### Utility specification

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/transit_sub_shop2.png")
```

### Notes

As with the other submodels, a VOT of 11.9 $/hr was used to obtain the Fare
coefficient.

# Homebased work trips

## W_HB_W

These are trips on a work tour with one end being home and the other being work.
During the estimation process, the full nesting structure including all modes in
the transit sub-nest were specified. The utility equations from the work transit
nest model along with their coefficients were retained (and fixed), except the
transit sub-mode ASCs. These were allowed to be determined by the estimation.
This was done to enable the estimation to adjust the constants of the transit
mode to fit the top-level shares from the household travel survey. A weighted
estimation using the trip weights was performed.

The utility spec for the combined data is shown below. Note that the transit
sub-mode utilities are not shown in the table (see above).

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/w_hb_w1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

```

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/w_hb_w3.png")
```

As expected, the time coefficients are highly significant. The TNC time
coefficient is deemed less onerous than other auto modes, which is an intuitive
result given that you don’t have to drive and can (e.g.) read a book.

Toll coefficients for the auto modes were computed using a VOT of 16.4 $/hr.

The nest structure for the NonHHAuto is justified, given the tStat of the nest
coefficient of -11.8. The Auto nest is also retained despite the nest
coefficient having a low tStat.

Parking logsums have a significant effect on the SOV and HOV modes as well as
the OtherAuto mode. As parking conditions deteriorate, trips shift into modes
like Transit, AutoPay, and OtherAuto.

High Income has a positive effect on the SOV and HOV modes. Similarly, vehicle
insufficient households have a higher tendency to prefer AutoPay and OtherAuto
modes as opposed to SOV and HOV modes.

During application, the model is applied to five segments and four time periods
(20 combinations). The segments are v0 (Zero Autos); Low-Income and High-Income
vehicle insufficient HHs (ilvi and ihvi); and Low-Income and High-Income vehicle
sufficient HHs (ilvs and ihvs). The coefficients of the high income and vehicle
insufficient utility terms are enforced depending on the segment.

TNC wait times and fares are used as utility variables for the AutoPay mode and
the computation of these variables is described in the Accessibility page.

## W_HB_O

The survey revealed that nearly all the transit trips for this type are walk
access. Therefore, the PNR and KNR branches were removed from the transit nest
in the final specification. The Transit node only has the walk-local and
walk-express alternatives. The appropriate utility equations and coefficients
(except the ASCs) for the walk-local and walk-express modes from the work
transit sub-nest model are fixed based on the transit submodel estimation. The
final nesting structure is shown below.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/w_hb_o1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/w_hb_o5.png")
```

As with W_HB_W, the time coefficients are highly significant in this model. The
VOT for the Auto modes computed from the time and cost estimates is close to the
desired value of time of $16.4/hr.

Although a nest coefficient for the Auto mode could not be estimated, this
coefficient was set to 0.75 to match the estimated value from the w_hb_w model.
Since this purpose consists of short errands on the work tour, parking logsums
for work were not found to be significant.

Other similarities to W_HB_W included the positive effect of high income on auto
modes persisted and the preference of vehicle insufficient households to use
OtherAuto and Transit modes

## W_HB_EK12

These are school pick up and drop off trips and the survey indicates that the
two predominant modes were HOV2 and HOV3. Rather than estimate a mode choice
model, a simple probability split of 50.4% for HOV2 and 49.6% for HOV3 was used.

# Homebased non-work trips

The purposes N_HB_OME, N_HB_ODShort, N_HB_ODLong, N_HB_OMED and N_HB_K12 fall
under this category. Typically, Caliper observed that transit PNR and KNR modes
were seldom used for these purposes. The tree structure for these purposes is
shown below. 

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/nhb_full_nest.png")
```

N_HB_K12 is the one exception to the above graphic, as it includes a SchoolBus
mode rather than walk to express bus.

## N_HB_OME

These are home based trips on non-work tours that involve shopping, eating out
and other maintenance cash spending activities. Therefore, the transit nest
model for the shop purpose (with the walk-local and walk-express alternatives)
is used. This is the only model where the ‘Shop’ transit sub-nest coefficients
are used. As expected, for trips such as shopping, PNR and KNR modes were not
chosen. If a person has access to a car, they will use it buy groceries rather
than try and carry them on the bus.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_ome1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

```

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_ome4.png")
```


Parking logsums have an important effect on choice of auto modes, which makes
sense. For work trips, travelers have to work near their job and parking is less
of a consideration. For non-mandatory trips like shopping, people are more
sensitive to parking cost and availability.

High income has a positive effect on HOV and an even larger positive effect on
SOV trips. At the same time, the HH Size 1 coefficient is highly negative for
HOV trips (which is intuitive). Vehicle sufficiency plays a significant role in
choice of SOV and other modes (with varying effects).

Because estimation is done on dissaggregate survey records, the high-income
housing variable was either 1 or 0. During model application, which is
aggregate, the percent of the zone that is high income is used. This can take
values between 0 and 1.

## N_HB_OD_Short

These are home based other trips with a short duration that are part of a
non-work tour. The walk access branch (with the walk-local and walk-express
alternatives) from the ‘Other’ transit nest model is used.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_short1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_short2.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_short3.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_short4.png")
```

The coefficients for the Non-HHAuto modes during the estimation had incorrect
signs and were generally not significant. Therefore, a binary choice model with
the alternatives AutoPay and OtherAuto was estimated from the survey using all
the home-based trips on non-work tours. Only trips that chose these two
alternatives were used in the estimation. The binary choice model coefficients
and utility equations were fixed in the final mode choice model. This increased
sample size allowed Caliper to achieve appropriate coefficients.

Coefficients match similar patterns shown by other purposes and are logical.


## N_HB_OD_Long

These are home based other trips with a long duration that are part of a
non-work tour. The walk access branch (with the walk-local and walk-express
alternatives) from the ‘Other’ transit nest model is used.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_long1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_long2.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_long3.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_od_long4.png")
```

All coefficients are intuitive as seen in other models. For example, time
coefficients are significant and parking logsums indidicate correct model
response to parking variables.

## N_HB_OMED

These are home based medical related trips (including pharmacies) that are part
of a non-work tour. The walk access branch (with the walk-local and walk-express
alternatives) from the ‘Other’ transit nest model is used.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_omed1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_omed4.png")
```

During the initial estimation, the time coefficient (along with an asserted toll
coefficient derived from the time coefficient) for the auto modes had a positive
sign. A model without the toll coefficient however yielded a feasible value for
the time coefficient. This value was fixed in the final estimation along with
the asserted toll coefficient using the value of time of $11.9/hr.

Other coefficients follow the same logical patterns as other purposes.

## N_HB_K12

These are home based school related trips that are part of a non-work tour and
include school trips made by kids and drop off trips made by adults. The survey
indicated that walk-to-local bus was the only transit mode used. AutoPay was
also not used. Therefore, a simple MNL model with the modes SOV, HOV2, HOV3,
OtherAuto, Walk-Local transit, and SchoolBus was estimated. The utility equation
for the walk local transit was borrowed from the ‘Other’ transit sub-mode model.

### Utility specification

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_k12_1.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/n_hb_k12_2.png")
```

### Notes

The time coefficients are significant as expected, and the school bus time is
actually more onerous compared to driving kids to school. This is an amusing
result that is nevertheless intuitive for anyone who rode the bus as a child.

Large HHs prefer school pickup/drop-offs compared to riding the bus.

Choice of mode for this purpose is probably determined by several other factors
specific to individual households and are thus not adequately captured by a
choice model. Nevertheless, a choice model helps fix the shares of the primary
modes for this purpose, namely SchoolBus and HOV

# Calibration

Mode choice ASCs were calibrated to match the adjusted targets shown below. The
mode choice targets are generated from the survey for each combination of trip
purpose and HH market segment. Note that target shares are not split by transit
sub-mode due to the lack of transit trips in the survey. The shares vary
significantly by market segment, especially for the zero-auto segment as
expected. Further, during the transit ridership validation, the survey transit
targets were scaled down to match transit boardings.

The additional ASC adjustments were not large, which increased confidence in the
estimated coefficients.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/asc_calibration.png")
```

# Application

As mentioned, the mode choice output shares can only be applied after the
destination choice model has been run. However, the destination choice model
requires mode choice logsums by mode, period, purpose and segment. To facilitate
this, the mode choice models are run first and the probability matrices and
logsums are calculated and stored. After the destination choice model is
complete, the stored probability matrices are used to split the appropriate PA
matrices by mode. The following rules are used during the mode choice
application for a specific purpose, segment and time period.

- For the zero-vehicle segment, SOV, HOV2 and HOV3 are made unavailable.
- The appropriate skims are used depending on the time period.
- Transit modes are automatically dropped for matrix cells with missing transit
skim values.

# Rail and BRT

Rail and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) do not exist in the Triangle in 2020; however,
the region is actively studying these modes for the future. As a result, Caliper
asserted mode choice nests for Light Rail (LR), Commuter Rail (LR), and BRT.
This assertion combined revealed modal data from the on-board survey (just as
value of time coefficients) and guidelines provided by FTA and used in the STOPS
model
([link1](https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/stops-workshop-atlantic-city-may-17-2015)
[link2](https://www.fsutmsonline.net/images/uploads/Task_1_Guidebook_for_Florida_STOPS_Application.pdf)).

The first FTA factor to consider is what they call "Visibility". In short, as
more of the service operates on fixed guideway, the higher this factor goes
(bounded between 0 and 1).

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/fta_visibility.png")
```

For TRMG2, the following visibility factors were assumed:

- BRT: 0.25
- LRT: 0.50
- CRT: 1.00

Additionally, the graphic below shows the FTA guidance on path-based constants.
These are presented as penalties added to bus, but Caliper applied them as
bonuses for rail and BRT.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/fta_path_constants.png")
```

TRMG2 market segmentation does not match the above chart exactly. Caliper made
the following assumptions about equivalency:

- zero-vehicle segment (v0): 0 vehicle households
- vehicle insufficient segment (vi): 1 vehicle households
- vehicle sufficient segment (vs): 2+ vehicle households

Additionally, the cost coefficients from estimation (generally around .022) were
within the FTA guidance of .02 - .03. Caliper applied the following discounts
to in-vehicle time (adjusted based on our assumed visibility scores):

- BRT: 5%
- LRT: 10%
- CRT: 20%

The table below is a concrete example of how LRT was modified for the
N_HB_OD_Short purpose. In the gray cells, the numbers in blue show the
modifications. The IVTT time is discounted and the mode is given bonus path type
constants based on visibility, market segment, and scaled by G2s cost
coefficient.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mc/lr_adjustment.png")
```

Additionally, Caliper compared these adjustments to the existing TRMV6.2 model.
In that model, a single premium mode exists with the following adjustments:

- IVTT discount of 15%
- 30 bonus minutes added to the constant

All else equal, TRMG2s smaller discounts and bonuses should lead to more
conservative ridership estimates. However, during planning analysis, the region
can adjust the visibility factors to reflect the actual service being planned.
For example, if planned BRT service operates fully inside reserved right of
way, the visibility factor should be increased.
